      <h3>Protecting Pets and People</h3>
      <p>The Naic Dog Pound is dedicated to creating a safe and healthy community for both animals and residents through responsible pet management and public education.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      The Naic Dog Pound was established in response to the growing need to control the increasing number of stray dogs and to maintain cleanliness and public safety in the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began with the implementation of a city ordinance enacted by the local government of Naic, which aimed to regulate the stray animal population as part of the town's public health and safety initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ordinance provided the legal foundation for creating a facility focused on capturing, caring for, and properly handling stray or abandoned animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the Naic Dog Pound is to protect the public from the dangers of rabies, dog bites, and other diseases that stray animals may carry, while also promoting responsible pet ownership.
    </p>
    <p>
      We implement programs such as spaying/neutering, adoption services, and educational campaigns on proper animal care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since its establishment, the Naic Dog Pound has played a vital role in helping maintain peace, order, and safety in the communities of Naic, while providing compassionate care for animals in need.
